This was an extremely interesting project. I am completing this project as part of the Flatiron Data Science bootcamp and I approached it using some traditional techniques and a little experimentation. 

For this project we are looking to maximize the profit when selling a home in Seattle. 

We are primarily concerned with:
What influences the housing prices in King County?
If they built a new home how accurately could we predict the sale price?

Value: Creating a model with high predictive ability will allow us to improve our original asking price for the homes we sell (so we can sell more profitably) and allow buyers to forecast what they will spend to enter this market.
